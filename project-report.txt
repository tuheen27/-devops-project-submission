Project Report: Static Website Deployment on AWS

Overview
This project focused on the end-to-end deployment of a five-page static website to establish a foundational DevOps workflow. The primary objective was to move from local development to a cloud-hosted environment, leveraging AWS services to learn resource provisioning, web server configuration, and production deployment practices.

Step-by-step process
1. Requirement Analysis & Planning: Defined the architectural scope and content layout for the static web application.
2. Application Development: Developed the core static artifacts (HTML/CSS) for all five content pages.
3. Version Control Integration: Implemented Git for source code management and pushed the repository to GitHub to ensure version tracking and collaborative readiness.
4. Infrastructure Provisioning: Provisioned an AWS EC2 instance to host the application.
5. Web Server Configuration: Installed and configured the Nginx web server on the EC2 instance to serve static content and handle HTTP requests.
6. Network Stabilization: Allocated and associated an AWS Elastic IP to the instance to guarantee a persistent public endpoint even after reboots.
7. Quality Assurance: Conducted final integration testing to verify page routing, link integrity, and overall functional stability.

Errors you faced
- SSH Connectivity Failure: Connection timeouts and permission errors occurred when attempting to establish an SSH session to the EC2 instance over port 22.
- Asset Resolution Failure: CSS stylesheets failed to load during the initial deployment, which rendered unstyled pages.
- Nginx Service Failure: The Nginx web server refused to start due to syntax errors in the configuration file.

How you solved them
- Network Troubleshooting: Identified that the local network firewall blocked port 22, then connected via a mobile hotspot to establish the SSH tunnel successfully.
- Path Debugging: Audited the directory structure and relative paths in the HTML files, correcting references so CSS assets were properly loaded.
- Configuration Audit: Validated the Nginx configuration syntax and cross-referenced AWS documentation and community posts to correct the server block directives, allowing the service to start normally.
