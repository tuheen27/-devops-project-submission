Project Report: Apex Solutions Website

Overview
For this project, I developed a responsive, multi-page website for "Apex Solutions," a digital marketing and web design agency. The main goal was to build a professional digital presence that looks good on any device. I used standard HTML5 and CSS3 to keep things lightweight and fast, sticking to a modern color palette of dark gray and orange.

Step-by-Step Process
1. Getting Started: I kicked things off by setting up my project folder and initializing Git so I could track my changes. I created the four main HTML files (Home, About, Services, Contact) and a blank CSS file.
2. Building the Structure: I wrote the HTML code for the navigation bar, the hero section on the homepage, and the basic layouts for the other pages. I used a grid layout for the services to keep them organized.
3. Styling: Once the structure was there, I used CSS to apply the branding. I chose a "Segoe UI" font for a clean look and set up the navigation to highlight whichever page the user is currently on.
4. Adding Content: I swapped out the initial placeholder text with actual descriptions of the company and its services. I also grabbed some high-quality photos from Unsplash to give the site a more polished feel.
5. Refining: Finally, I went through and tweaked a few things, like removing the fixed pricing from the services page to make the business model look more flexible.

Errors I Faced
- Messy Images: When I first added the team photo to the About page, it was huge. It completely broke the layout when I tried to view it on a smaller screen.
- Generic Content: At first, I left a lot of "Lorem Ipsum" text in there. It made the whole site feel like a template rather than a real business.
- Pricing Issues: I initially hard-coded prices like "$1,000+" for web design. I realized later that this might scare off clients or limit the company's ability to quote custom projects.

How I Solved Them
- Fixing the Images: I wrote a simple CSS class called `.responsive-image`. I set the max-width to 100% and the height to auto. This makes sure the image shrinks down nicely to fit whatever screen it's on.
- Writing Real Copy: I took some time to write actual paragraphs about "driving business growth" and "cutting-edge design." It made a huge difference in how professional the site feels.
- Removing Prices: I decided to just remove the pricing lines from the HTML entirely. Now, the services page focuses on the value provided, encouraging clients to reach out for a quote instead.
